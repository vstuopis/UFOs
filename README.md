# UFOs

## Analysis Overview

UFO sightings and those who track them want to have access to when the siting occured, the location, type of sighting and additional information. We have built this site to allow for quick access to this data in a filtered format. This filtered format will allow you to search exactly the type of sighting you desire!

## Results

On the site, we want to make it simple to search using the filters provided, please see the below steps for detailed instructions:

1. Choose the filter you want to search on and type in your search criteria (in this case we choose the City field)

2. The table data will filter based on your selection when you click off the field

3. To add additional filters choose another search criteria and being from Step 1.

4. To reset the filter, delete what you've typed.
  

## Summary

One drawback of the webpage is that there is no dropdown for the country filter which will lead to many times no data being returned

There are two additional recommendations for further development:
* Having the ability to allow for partial searches based on the characters already included will improve user experience   
* Being able to sort the columns in the table will be helpful to clean up the data in alphabetical format
